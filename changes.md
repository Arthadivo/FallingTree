* Add an option `ignore_tools` to ignore tool detection (this has the same effect as whitelisting everything, including empty hand).
* Add an option `break_mode` to choose how to break the tree. INSTANTANEOUS is the default and what you have been using up to now. Though there is a new addition, SHIFT_DOWN, where instead of breaking everything, the log will slowly fall to the ground as you chop it.
