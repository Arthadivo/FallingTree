== Intro

Here I'll try to explain in a bit more details what are the different settings you'll find in FallingTree and when possible give some examples so it's clearer.

There's 3 main sections that you'll find in the configuration file or in the config GUI:

* link:Settings---General[General]
* link:Settings---Trees[Trees]
* link:Settings---Tools[Tools]

Examples of full config files can be found link:Settings---Examples[here].

== Server

You have several options :

* Edit the config file in the config directory.
* Edit the configuration through the GUI on aclient and upload the updated configuration file to the server.

== GUI

WARNING: This method is only supported in both Fabric and Forge in 1.16.4+ releases.

The config GUI offers you an easier way to edit the configuration.
Instead of going into the configuration files and edit them manually, just navigate through an in-game menu.

This GUI isn't activated by default and need a dependency for that.

=== Forge

The dependency needed is https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config-forge[Cloth Config API (Forge)].
When this is installed alongside FallingTree, you'll be able to go into `Main menu > Mods > FallingTree > Config`.

=== Fabric
The dependency needed is https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu[Mod Menu].
When this is installed alongside FallingTree, you'll be able to go inside `Mods > FallingTree > Config`.
