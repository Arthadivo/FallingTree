# Falling Tree

This mod will allow you to break a full tree by only breaking one log off of it. Sneaking will disable this functionality.

![Demonstration of breaking a tree](https://github.com/RakSrinaNa/FallingTree/raw/1.14.4/assets/demo.gif)

Several options are available in the config file:

* Add more types of logs or ban some
* Add more types of tools or ban some
* Limit the maximum number of blocks to break at once
* Damage tools or not
* Let tools at 1 durability if it's going to break
* Option to disable the effect of the mod by sneaking (can be reversed)
* Break leaves instantly

NOTE: On servers this mod can be server-side only, client isn't required.
