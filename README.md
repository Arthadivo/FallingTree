# Falling Tree

This mod will allow you to break a full tree by only breaking one log off of it. Sneaking will disable this functionality.

Several options are available in the config file:
- logs_whitelisted: A list of the log blocks you want the mod to work on.
- tools_whitelisted: A list of tools you can break a tree with for the mod to apply.
- ignore_durability: If activated breaking down a tree won't damage your tool.
- max\_log\_count: The maximum number of log a tree can be mad of (if more the mod won't apply).
- preserve_tools: If this option is enabled your tool won't be broken by chopping down a big tree, it'll instead be left with 1 of durability.
